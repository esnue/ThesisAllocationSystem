Constraining ourselves to few or one particular Journal outlet could have made the cleaning process and possibly the model training easier but would also have considerably reduced the size of the train data. \n",

This is a very common application of text classification, where a given document can be classified into one or more categories. This approach best mirrors our use case where a thesis proposal could likely be allocated to more than one research area, given the interdisciplinary nature and overlap of research areas between chairs.\n",
