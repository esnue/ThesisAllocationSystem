        "\n",
        "The goal of the model is the ability to match students based on their thesis proposals to supervisors based on the content of their academic papers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using academic papers as train data is an approach that was proposed by the similarly-working [Toronto Matching System](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~zemel/documents/tpms.pdf). Instead of matching students to professors, the Toronto Matching Systems assigns Peer-Reviewers based on their academic papers to submitted papers.\n",
        "\n",
        "While thesis proposals tend to be coherent in their structure, academic papers tend to be very unstructured. Constraining ourselves to few or one particular Journal outlet could have made the cleaning process and possibly the model training easier but would also have considerably reduced the size of the train data. \n",
        "\n",
        "Our multi-label text-classification method is based on Transformers and Pre-Trained Language Models. The Pre-Trained Mode is state-of-art [DistilBert](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108). The Transformers version is [4.4.2](https://huggingface.co/transformers/).\n",
        "\n",
        "We are finetuning a pretrained DistilBERT model for multilabel text classification. This is a very common application of text classification, where a given document can be classified into one or more categories. This approach best mirrors our use case where a thesis proposal could likely be allocated to more than one research area, given the interdisciplinary nature and overlap of research areas between chairs.\n",

        "Before you attempt to run the script, make sure to secure the required modules and datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "**At the current phase of our project, every paper in the train data set has been assigned only one label. As a future direction of this approach, papers could be assigned multiple labels. AREN'T WE MATCHING PROFS AND PROPOSALS, SO LABELING DOES NOT MATTER BECAUSE THE MODEL WILL LEARN THE ACADEMIC NICHE OF THE PROF AND WE ONLY USE THE LABEL FOR US TO BE ABLE TO READLY ASSIGN A BROAD FIELD TO THEM?**"
